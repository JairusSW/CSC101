CSC101 Project 2 - Snack Vending Machine
Your task is to develop a snack vending machine application that meets the following criteria:
~~1. Allow users to select from 1 to n snacks (candy, chips, and other snacks) from your vending machine~~
~~2. You must include a minimum of 6 different snacks in your snack machine.~~
~~3. Each snack includes a picture of the snack (use the Internet to find images)~~
~~4. The price for the snack (vary the price for each item)~~
~~5. A visible counter which indicates the number of each snack available for purchase (begin with five of each item, inform users if the selected item has no remaining inventory)~~
~~6. Buttons to add each snack to the cart~~
~~7. A check out button that shows the total purchase amount~~
~~8. A reset button that will return all settings to their original configuration~~
~~9. An exit button~~
Make sure you develop an attractive, professional and clear user interface, and elegant and fully documented code with appropriate exception handling. Provide sufficient instruction for the user to know what to do.  You can do this all on one form, or you can provide an introductory form, like we did in the first project.
You are going to need to pass arguments to methods, and you must create value-returning methods to aid in the process. (for example, maybe to calculate the totals, and decrease the available units) 
To turn in your project, zip the entire project folder and upload it to eLearning before the due date.
